- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact assessment and suggested severity
- Any potential mitigations you've identified

#### 2. Encrypted Communication (Optional)

For sensitive disclosures, use our PGP key:

- **High severity:** Patched within **14 days**
- **Medium severity:** Patched within **30 days**
- **Low severity:** Patched within **90 days**

**Disclosure:**

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          | End of Support |
| ------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| 0.x.x   | :white_check_mark: | Active Development |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: | TBD (when released) |

**Note:** As an early-stage project, we're currently supporting the latest development version. Once we reach 1.0, we'll maintain the latest major version plus security patches for the previous major version.

## Security Update Policy

### Update Channels

1. **Security Advisories**
   - Published at: https://github.com/open-hims/rustcare-engine/security/advisories
   - Includes severity, impact, and mitigation steps

2. **Security Releases**
   - Tagged with `security-` prefix (e.g., `v0.5.1-security`)
   - Published on GitHub Releases
   - Includes upgrade instructions

3. **Notifications**
   - GitHub Security Advisories (automatic)
   - Mailing list: security-announce@openhims.health (planned)
   - RSS feed: https://github.com/open-hims/rustcare-engine/security/advisories.atom

### Patch Distribution

Security patches are released as:
- Source code updates on GitHub
- Docker images with updated tags
- Cargo crate updates (when published)
- Binary releases for supported platforms

---

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### 1. Keep Software Updated

```bash
# Check for updates weekly
git pull origin main
cargo update

# Review security advisories
gh api /repos/open-hims/rustcare-engine/security-advisories
```

### 2. Use Secrets Management

**Never hardcode secrets.** Use:
- HashiCorp Vault
- AWS Secrets Manager
- Azure Key Vault
- Kubernetes Secrets

See: [Secrets Service Documentation](docs/SECRETS_API.md)

### 3. Enable Audit Logging

```toml
# config/audit.toml
[audit]
enabled = true
log_level = "info"
retention_days = 2555  # 7 years for HIPAA compliance
tamper_evident = true
```

### 4. Configure TLS/SSL

```toml
# config/tls.toml
[tls]
enabled = true
cert_file = "/path/to/cert.pem"
key_file = "/path/to/key.pem"
min_version = "1.3"  # TLS 1.3 minimum
```

### 5. Implement Network Segmentation

- Deploy auth services in separate network zone
- Use firewall rules to restrict access
- Enable DDoS protection
- Use VPN for administrative access

### 6. Regular Security Audits

```bash
# Run security audit tools
cargo audit
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo deny check

# Static analysis
cargo-geiger  # Check unsafe code usage
```

### 7. Monitor and Alert

- Enable application monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Set up security event alerts
- Review audit logs regularly
- Track failed authentication attempts
