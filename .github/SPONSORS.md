# 💖 Sponsor RustCare - Open Source Healthcare

## Our Mission

**Healthcare is too expensive.** We're building open-source, enterprise-grade healthcare software to eliminate expensive licensing fees and make quality healthcare accessible to everyone—from small clinics in rural areas to large hospitals worldwide.

By open-sourcing RustCare, we're saving the healthcare industry billions of dollars that should go to patient care, not software licenses.
