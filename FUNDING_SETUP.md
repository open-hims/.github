Subject: Partnership Opportunity - Open Source Healthcare Platform

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out from RustCare, an open-source healthcare platform that's
eliminating expensive EMR/EHR licensing fees ($50k-500k/year) that drive
up healthcare costs.

We've built a complete, modular healthcare platform in Rust with:
- Zero licensing fees (Apache 2.0)
- HIPAA/GDPR compliant
- Runs on Raspberry Pi ($50/month for small clinics)
- 10x performance of legacy systems

We're looking for sponsors to support development and are offering:
- [Specific tier benefits]
- [Custom value proposition for their use case]

Would you be interested in learning more?

[Link to one-pager]
[Link to GitHub Sponsors]

Best regards,
RustCare Team
```

### Grant Application Introduction

```
RustCare is an open-source healthcare platform designed to make enterprise-grade
healthcare software accessible to everyone, from small rural clinics to large
hospitals.

Problem: Healthcare costs are skyrocketing partly due to expensive software
licensing fees ($50k-500k/year per hospital). These costs are passed to patients.

Solution: We've open-sourced a complete, modular, Rust-based healthcare platform
with zero licensing fees, saving the industry billions while improving security
and performance.

Impact: Already built with HIPAA compliance, WCAG accessibility, and can run
on $100 Raspberry Pis for resource-constrained settings.

Funding Need: [Specific amount for specific purpose]

[Link to detailed proposal]
